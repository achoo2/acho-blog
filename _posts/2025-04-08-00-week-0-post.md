Day 5 (Sat)
- went to DÃ­a 
- stepped in dog poo :(
- most people talk to me in English which is a little disheartening
- visited bookstore. Pretty cool. Found some interesting books, translated into Spanish. It would've been good practice if I were able to trick myself that I would read a lot during my time here
	- I would've liked to stick around more, but and I didn't want to track in dog poo any more than I already was
	- Maybe another time!
-
